# Minkowski-Sum-Calculator
An interactive tool for understanding the concept of minkowski sum

Things are really easy when done right: I was trying to understand the concept of minkowski sum, and I read some 
textbooks and wathced some tutorials to understand it, in fact it took more than it should have to learn what it actually was since 
I am a visual learner. But there wasn't anything visual other than tutorials, so I really needed to draw arbitrary shapes and see 
their mikowski sums, but I couldn't find any quick software to do that, so I made it myself.

I made this using javascript, and used lots of dot products and 2D vectors and stuff.
The program manually calculates the mikowski sum of two convex shapes that is drawn by the user.
